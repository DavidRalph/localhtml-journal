<!-- 
  This file contains the fixed content of the sheet.

  All content that should be printed must be wrapped in a element with the "page" class.
  Each "page" element is a side of US letter paper.

  <div class="page">
    <h1>I am a page</h1>
  </div>

  You can specify stylings in styles.css, or any other css file imported in overrides.js
  To include images, set them as a background URL so webpack can inline them.

<form class="page placeholder-background-image">
  <h1>Welcome to localhtml</h1>
  <p>
    Any changes made to the content of these pages is persisted when saving, and
    the full functionality of the document is available offline just by opening
    the HTML file (all the source code and state data are included in the file).
    You can create pages in content.html with forms which can save arbitrary
    data. Form controls serialise to a key matching their name property. What
    name you choose only matters if you want to implement your own logic with
    JavaScript, but every form element must have a unique name for it to be
    saved.
  </p>
  <p>e.g. &ltinput name="fileNameField"/&gt is saved to data["fileNameField"]</p>
  <label>
    <strong>File Name</strong>
    <input type="text" name="fileNameField" />
  </label>
  <p>
    Users can add extra pages using the controls at the bottom of the page.
    These pages can only be full-page rich text editors, but can be added,
    removed, and rearranged at any time. You can also add rich text editors to
    forms, as shown here.
  </p>
  <article name="myQuillField" class="quill_field"></article>
  <p>
    Each page is 1-to-1 size of US letter paper and when you print the document
    everything else is stripped away, so you can treat the pages just like real
    paper.
  </p>
</form>

<h2>Did you know?</h2>
<p>
  You can add content outside of a page element, but it will be excluded when
  printing.
</p>

<form class="page">
  <p>
    You can have multiple pre-defined forms and pages, but they cannot be
    reordered or deleted by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data for all forms is saved as one object, so field names must be unique
    across all forms. However, this also means that you can move fields from one
    form to another without breaking backwards compatibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data object is generated when needed by reading the form controls, so
    you can modify their values using JavaScript in all the usual ways.

  <label>
    <strong>Text Field 1</strong>
    <input type="text" name="textField1" />
  </label>
  <label>
    <strong>Text Field 2</strong>
    <input type="text" name="textField2" />
  </label>
  <button id="myButton">Click to copy Text Field 1 to Text Field 2</button>
  <label>
    <strong>These fields swap when you click away</strong>
    <input type="text" name="textField3" />
    <input type="text" name="textField4" />
  </label>
</form>
